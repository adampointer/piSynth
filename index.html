          <h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>This is an FM synthesiser with a browser front-end for fiddling about with and tweaking all the synthesis parameters. I am using it on a Raspberry Pi but it could be used on any platform that can feasibly compile and run it.</p>

<h2>Node.js? Why?</h2>

<p>Actually Node.js is a good fit for this project, aside from the fact that it is super-trendy at the moment. It handles events very well and a MIDI input to PCM output with an HTTP interface is largely about events. A key is pressed on the keyboard triggering a MIDI event, this needs to be handled and trigger a note to be played. An envelope is modified in the HTTP interface firing a PUT request to the server, again, this is an event. Although anything involving hardware is written in C/C++, node.js is perfect for quickly and elegantly glueing everything together. And it is fun.</p>

<h2>Is it ready for use?</h2>

<p>No. It plays basic sounds and you can change the ADSR envelope. Performance is poor on the Raspberry Pi but compiling the PCM module to use the FPU should help. I want to implement some kind of LUT/simple caching for the waveform generation. That will also help massively. Also I have loads more params that I want to be controlled from the browser and then I want to be able to load/save settings.</p>

<h2>How to use?</h2>

<p>Compile the PCM modules with node-gyp, run the synth, then connect to the hardware.</p>

<p><code>node-gyp configure build</code>
<code>node pi-synth.js</code>
<code>aconnect -i</code>
<code>aconnect -o</code></p>

<p>Make a note of the id of your MIDI keybaoard (real or virtual) and the id of the synth and glue them together.</p>

<p><code>aconnect &lt;IN&gt; &lt;OUT&gt;</code> </p>
